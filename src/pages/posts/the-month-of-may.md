### THE MONTH OF MAY

Phew! This monthâ€™s recap has the shortest length of words compared to previous months. Well, you can already tell I achieved next to nothing.

It went by so fast and I remember vividly lazing about. I worked just 18 days as well. I really didnâ€™t see the need writing about how it went to be honest. I made a promise to myself to always have a monthly report which is why I am writing thisðŸ˜©.

\
The month of June is almost coming to an end and I can barely remember a thing that happened in May. I guess sometimes you cut yourself some slack right? I kind of feel bad about it but I rather pick up the lessons and move on.

For the month of May, the few things I remember doing where:

* Saving 20% of my salary
* Exercising but very minimal
* Reading two great books ðŸ”¥(Ego is the enemy by Ryan Holiday and the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho)
* Working
* No articles
* No youtube videos
* No challenge ðŸ¤’

I guess that is just all, hopefully June report will make more sense.

See you soonðŸ˜˜\

Thanks for reading.
