### THE MONTH OF APRIL

You know how I always begin this report, which is telling you how good the month went in general? Well, not this one. I am starting with a showoff üòÇ, yes I said it!. I killed it this month guys! For the first time in my life, I completed a 28 DAYS CHALLENGEü•≥ which I will discuss in detail in a bit.

Now how did the month go? It went pretty well. I did a couple of challenges and I must tell you, I am getting better at this challenge thing.

I celebrated my birthday on the 10th of this month, my friends surprised me and I got gifts as well which I had to do a Gulder Ultimate Search to find. Things like this happen when you have crazy friends.

I set a couple of goals this month, I didn‚Äôt tick off the entire list but I can say I completed over 80% which is still an A. Little excuses and laziness here and there but I keep getting better, learning about myself, growing and staying healthy.

### **THE BREAKDOWN**

1. ***The jump jack challenge***: Why I wrote it first is because it gives me so much joy. I challenged myself to do a 500 JJ challenge every day for the month of April using 2 days as a rest day. Just to give my body a little rest since I still do my regular exercise. I‚Äôve got procrastination issues but being able to achieve this made me realise its all in my head, once you put your mind to it, I think you can achieve it.
2. ***Save***: I am not a huge spender after my necessary personal and family expenses, the rest goes into my savings for now till I am ready to invest.
3. ***3 days detox***: I decided to try out taking just fruits for three days. I spaced the days out because I do high-intensity training most mornings. The last day, I was quite hungry, I decided to add little proteins. In all, it was a good experience.
4. ***Exercise***: It is now a lifestyle, I workout 6 days a week, thanks to my friends, they motivate me too.
5. ***Start a youtube channel***: I have always wanted to start, different excuses but this time we conquered. I put out my first video the last Saturday of April, you can watch and subscribe [here](https://youtu.be/6kbK2mLszeo). It is going to be more of my cooking, weight loss journey, travels, and real-life talk with my friends and whoever is interested.
6. ***Write three articles***: I decided to be writing at least two articles a month, to enable me to get better at it and also to avoid cobwebs on my blogü§£. I wrote three articles with this included, you can read them [here](https://dinma.netlify.com).
7. ***Study the word of God***: I won‚Äôt even lie, before I started this challenge of reading the word of God daily, I usually make excuses every time I wake that I was going to study it but I end up not doing it. I know as a Christian and the kind of relationship I want to build with my creator, I have to do better, I came up with a spreadsheet I usually tick off each day once I am done studying it. I skipped 10 days this month, I am not proud of it but there is huge progress. I know next month will be better.
8. ***Rice and soda challenge***: Drum roll, pleaseü•Å!!! I didn‚Äôt have rice or soda for the whole of AprilüèÖ. I just wanted to cut down on carbs and take more of vegetables, proteins, healthy fat, etc. I took spag and noodles very few times(their challenge will come soon). I cut down bread intake drastically as well, I had it three times this month.
9. ***Read a book***: I read an interesting book, mostly for married couples but I found it in my book collection for the year and I started it, the rest is history. *Sheet music sexuality in marriage by Kevin Leman,* it‚Äôs a really nice book. Any of my friends getting married will get a copy from meüòé.
10. ***Learn video editing***: One of the skills you need when you start a youtube channel is video editing. I am still a novice when it comes to this, but I started taking courses weekends. I edited my first youtube video with huge help from my [friend](https://medium.com/@annmaryamaka) who also started her [channel](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCsZkZQzMVNcErjwDMe4P8qw). We are learning the ropes together üçª.
11. ***Take courses on anger management***: Calm down! I am not a violent person. I decided to take courses on this because I have observed for long that slight things make me flare-up even though the anger does not last üòÑ, feedback from some close friends as well. I am learning and practicing, hopefully, I get better. One step at a time.
12. ***Skipping challenge***: I challenged myself to jump rope 4000 times for 5 days. I remembered back in school when I could skip 5000 daily, I decided to challenge myself to 4000 and it was a success.
13. ***The divine mercy prayer***: I am a catholic, this a prayer we say mostly by 3 pm. I took it seriously this month although I skipped a few days. I say the prayer with my friends.
14. ***Work***: To be honest, I love my job, my colleagues, and the work culture even makes it cooler! I know sometimes it can be challenging, always learning things here and there, facing blockers, bugs, etc but it‚Äôs all worth it. I keep pushing myself to be better.

I am very far from perfection, I do not even want to get there if it exists, all I want is constant growth and self-development.
