### Intentions

1. Keep being grateful

### Happenings

Guess who cycled on the road and not in a park today? You guessed right 😁. I was very scared but I conquered 💪🏽. Aside from cycling, I started the day quite early, for some reasons unknown to me I woke by 4:25 am. I couldn’t go back to sleep, I decided to go through my stocks and crypto portfolio to check out how my investments are doing only to discover a coin has done over a 100%. I was excited and it gave me the strength I needed to start the day.

I picked up my laptop and worked on some of the tickets assigned to me for the week. I finished around 6:45 am, I made my bed and exercised for the day. After my workout, I drank enough water and took a shower while listening to Joel Osteen( I recommend this). I finalized the editing of my latest [video](https://youtu.be/XKHapmc8_o8) which premiered today.

I attended my meetings at work, anchored one as well. I said my daily prayer and studied the word of God.

I didn’t get to read Atomic Habits today and I do not feel so good about it. In all, it was a great day!
