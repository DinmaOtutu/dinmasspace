# Intentions

1. I want to keep learning not to let fear win over me

# Happenings

Sometimes bad things happen around you and all it does is remind you of some horrible places and experiences you never wish to remember. Today had me reliving a bad experience I had some time in 2018. The feeling of inadequacy, sadness, tiredness, and unanswered questions.

On the other hand, two of my friends celebrated their birthdays. I am grateful to God for their lives and all his blessings and favors they are yet to experience.

I did my usual routine, I am really tired, my stomach hurts, and I feel like taking a little break.

Above all, I give thanks❤️
