# Intentions

1. Gratitude is a must

# Happenings

Today brings us to the end of the week day and like I mentioned yesterday, I didn’t work today but I did some tiny work on my personal brand. I shot a video on how I made a profit of 2400 dollars within 30 days through cryptocurrency, hoping that people would learn from it.

Aside shooting my video, I went for a ride, took some really nice pictures because I looked and felt cute today, spent time with my friends, spoke with my sister Ifeoma Otutu who is currently in boarding school.

I started a project in my dad’s house today and really hoping it turns out well by the time it is done. I also hope they get to enjoy the finished project as much as I want them to.

I worked out with my friends this morning, it was interesting because my second friends was the commander in chief, her comments made the workout fun and short. It was chilled day❤️.
