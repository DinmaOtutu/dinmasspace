### \#MyweightlossJourneyandstrugglesofar

Going from skinny to *orobo(fat) is so easy!!*I remember my early teenage years when I was skinny okay maybe not skinny but I wasn‚Äôt fat.

How time flies, I love food but I think at some point I lost control of what goes into my body. It started at the university when I was too lazy to cook, I ate every junk that came my way. I was able to shed the weight though because I exercised and ate healthier in my final year.

When I left university, I stayed approximately 6 months before going for my NYSC, that was when I started storing and gathering like I was packing food for famine(well, who knows? I just may be right üòé). I moved from 72 to 82kg. I struggled to exercise as well, I always had the excuse that I had no time because of work, all I just needed was to skip a few meals and I will get back in shape‚Ä¶story for the godsüòä!

I completed my NYSC and got a job, that was the height of it all. I worked late into the night with food either in my mouth or hand. I watched tutorials, movies, podcasts, all while eating. It made it worse, you would always want more food than you need JUST because you are carried away by whatever you are watching or listening to.

> ###### *Towards the end of 2019, I got to weigh myself at a clinic and I saw 2bags of rice on the scale ü§£ a whooping 100kg! Breathe Dinma! It was not funny, all I could do was laugh at the situation. I had moved from 72kg to 100kgü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I knew I had not been eating right and working out minimally so I didn‚Äôt except less but I never believed I could clock that number! I started exercising after work, we all know working out alone can be very demoralising. I promise I was trying really hard to keep up, I made a little progress, I think I lost about 3kg in a month. With that, I went home proud, only for Detty Decemeber to finish me. I ate like a ‚Ä¶!*

Self-control and Discipline! How these two words are a bit far from me when it comes to this weight loss of mine is appalling. I procrastinate a lot and can be undetermined most times, it‚Äôs a struggle people!.

This 2020, I made a resolution to register at the gym and get a personal trainer, to keep myself accountable, tone my body, and reduce excuses. Cut down my food intake, fewer carbs, more fruits, healthy fat, more vegetables, more exercise, and see how far we can go this time. So far I have lost 6kg although I haven‚Äôt seen much difference, little progress is progress. Hopefully, 2020 works like a charm. I have promised myself to do better, be better, be healthier and get the body I so much long for.

This is my struggle and I hope I make myself proud.
