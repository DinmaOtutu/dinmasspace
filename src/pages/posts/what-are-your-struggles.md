### **MY WEIGHT LOSS STRUGGLE**

Going from skinny to O*robo is so easy!!*I remember my early teen years when I was skinny okay maybe not skinny but I wasnâ€™t fat.

How time flies, I love food but I think at some point I lost control of what goes in and out of my body. It started at the university when I was too lazy to cook, I ate every junk that came my way. I was able to conquer because I worked out really hard in my final year and shed some fat.

When I left university, I stayed approximately 6 months before going for my NYSC, that was when I started storing and gathering like I was packing food for famine. I moved from 72 to 82kg. I struggled to exercise as well as giving excuses that I do not have time to work out all I needed was just to skip few meals and I will get back in shape, the story for the gods!

I completed my NYSC and got a job, that was the height of it all. I worked late into the night with food either in my mouth or my hand. I watched tutorials, movies, podcasts while eating. It made it worse, because you would always want more food than you need, you are carried away by whatever you are watching or listening to.

> > ###### *Towards the end of 2019, I got to weigh myself at a clinic and I saw 2bags of rice on the scale ðŸ¤£ whooping 100kg! Breathe Dinma! It was not funny but was fun. How I moved from 72kg to 100kg. I knew I had been eating very wrong and working out minimally so I didnâ€™t except less but I never believed I could clock that number!* I started exercising after work*, we all know working out alone can be very demoralising. I promise I was trying really hard to keep up, I made a little progress, I think I lost about 3kg in a month. With that, I went home proud, only for Detty Decemeber to finish me. I ate like a â€¦!*

Self-control and discipline! how these two words are a bit far from me when it comes to this weight loss of mine is appalling. I procrastinate a lot and can be undetermined most times, itâ€™s really a struggle people!.

This 2020, I made a resolution to register at the gym and get a personal coach, to keep myself accountable, tone my body, and reduce excuses. Cut down my food intake, fewer carbs, more fruits, healthy fat, more vegetables, more exercise, and see how far we can go this time. So far I have lost 6kg although I havenâ€™t seen much difference, little progress is progress. Hopefully, 2020 works like charm. I have promised myself to do better, be better, be healthier and get the body I so much long for.

This is my struggle and I hope I make myself proud.
