I am super excited to be sharing the February report card with you guys. I am also a believer in the saying “*If you plan to excel in big things, you have to develop the habit in the small ones.”*

I try to celebrate my wins no matter how little. All great things have small beginnings right?

This month was special to me because I focused majorly on my self and wellbeing. Just like I wrote in my [previous post](https://dinma.netlify.com/posts/2019-03-24-workplace/) that I would do better this month, I think I actually nailed it😎.

**Here we go**

* Sticking to four weeks workout challenge (exercise 5 days a week)
* Studying and mastering the tools I work with (still learning).
* Avoid soda, noodles, bread, late-night food, etc.
* Take a lot of fruits and vegetables
* Scoring over 75% in my book target for the month (Don’t judge me, it’s an A 💅🏼)\

  * Unfuck Yourself by Gary John Bishop (It’s an interesting read!)
  * Good Morning Holy Spirit by Benny Hinn(I am glad I found this book). I could not complete this one, it has been pushed over to March.
* Losing a minimum of 4kg
* Saving 60% of my salary (I tend to save a LOT)
* Writing this report card
* Build my personal blog. You are here. Hopefully, I get to write more and better. Contents will majorly be about my lifestyle, trips, new learnings, tech stuff and anything you guys want me to write about.
* This one is funny, but it’s huge progress for me. I didn’t bite my fingernails for the whole of February!!!!! First time since 1995

I still struggle with time management. Although there is a significant improvement, I mean I ticked off almost all of these except I struggled mostly with the food challenge, March will definitely be better, but looking at the bright side I lost **5KG**💪🏽.

We are definitely going to crush March, better than we did in January and February combined.

* The selected book for the month of March is **“I Can’t Make This Up: Life Lessons by Kevin Hart”** after finalising the **Good morning Holy Spirit** book.
* My target for March is to lose a minimum of 4.5kg
* The salary percentage to save is a minimum of 50%

The rest of the March journey will come by the end of the month, till then…

Thanks for reading.
